## Introduction

The Open Collab Entity is a new concept in collaboration that is designed to promote openness, transparency, and community in creative works. It is a collaborative entity that empowers creators to work together on projects of all kinds, from art and music to software and beyond.

At the heart of the Open Collab Entity is a new type of license that we have developed specifically for collaborative works. The Open Collab Entity License is a flexible and adaptable license that allows creators to work together on projects of all kinds, while ensuring that their rights are protected and their work is recognized.
